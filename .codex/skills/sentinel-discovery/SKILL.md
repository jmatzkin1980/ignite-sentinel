# Sentinel Discovery

Use this skill to start or refresh discovery for a project.

## Workflow

1. Confirm or create the project workspace with `python -m sentinel /init PROJECT_ID`.
2. Place domain-owned context in the workspace context folders when available:
   - `workspaces/PROJECT_ID/00_raw/01_business_context/`
   - `workspaces/PROJECT_ID/00_raw/02_technology_context/`
   - `workspaces/PROJECT_ID/00_raw/03_design_context/`
   - `workspaces/PROJECT_ID/00_raw/04_quality_context/`
   - `workspaces/PROJECT_ID/00_raw/05_interactions/`
3. Ingest raw material with `python -m sentinel /ingest PROJECT_ID --source PATH`.
4. Regenerate the shareable gap document when needed: `python -m sentinel /gaps PROJECT_ID`.
5. Use focused retrieval before analysis: `python -m sentinel /retrieve PROJECT_ID --query "DISCOVERY_TOPIC" --workflow discovery --write-pack`.
6. Review generated artifacts in `workspaces/PROJECT_ID/01_discovery/` and `02_requirements/`, especially `identity_seeds.md`, `discovery_log.md`, `lens_review.md`, `gaps.md`, and `requirements.md`.
7. Share `01_discovery/gaps.md` with the client or domain owner when maturity is blocked.
8. Run `python -m sentinel /health PROJECT_ID` before downstream specs or backlog work.

## Memory

- Sentinel uses local LanceDB memory under `workspaces/PROJECT_ID/memory.lancedb/`.
- `/ingest` indexes generated artifacts and context folders so Codex can retrieve technology, design, quality, business, and interaction evidence without generating those domain specs.
- If artifacts were edited manually, run `python -m sentinel /reindex PROJECT_ID` before relying on `/retrieve`.

## Rules

- Treat raw input as evidence, not truth.
- Treat technology, design, and quality context folders as source input owned by external domains.
- Scrutinize every initial requirement through Product/BA, Technology, Design, and Quality lenses before declaring it mature.
- Use the mature requirement rubric in `lens_review.md`: identity/value, actors, scope, as-is/to-be delta, business rules, data/integrations, non-functional constraints, UX journey/states, acceptance/quality, and delivery readiness.
- Use `references/requirement-maturity-gap-checklist.md` when deciding whether missing information should become a gap. This checklist covers the sweet spot for Product, Design/prototype readiness, Technology deep-dive readiness, Frontend, Backend, and Quality handoff.
- Convert missing or ambiguous information into explicit `GAP` entries.
- Treat `gaps.md` as a human response contract and a framework artifact. Do not strip IDs, response fields, or the trace table.
- Gap statuses are `OPEN`, `PARTIALLY_CLOSED`, `ANSWERED`, `CLOSED`, `SUPERSEDED`, `NEW_REQUIREMENT`, and `NEW_GAP`. Critical/high `OPEN`, `PARTIALLY_CLOSED`, or `ANSWERED` gaps still block maturity.
- Do not invent metrics, users, scope, or acceptance criteria.
- Preserve traceability from `RAW` to `SEED`, `DISC`, `REQ`, `GAP`, and `DEC`.
